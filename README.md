# Symptoms_Based_Diseases_Prediction

This project is a Python implementation of a machine learning model for predicting diseases based on symptoms reported by patients. The goal of the project is to provide an early diagnosis of diseases using symptoms reported by patients, which can help healthcare providers make informed decisions and provide timely treatment.

The project includes features such as collecting symptoms reported by patients, preprocessing the data to remove noise and inconsistencies, training a machine learning model to predict diseases, and evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics. The data used for the project is publicly available medical datasets that contain information about symptoms and diseases.

The program uses popular Python libraries for machine learning, such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy, to implement the model pipeline.

The project also includes a user interface for patients to input their symptoms and get a prediction of the most likely disease.

Overall, this project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning techniques in Python for disease prediction using symptoms reported by patients. It can be useful for healthcare providers, medical researchers, and data scientists interested in early diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and can be easily extended to other datasets or applications.
